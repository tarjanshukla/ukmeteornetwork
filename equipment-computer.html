         <p>During meteor shower peaks we can get 150-200 meteors per night on a single camera, each recording could be 100MB so that's 20GB of data right there in a single night. During shower peaks the Capture software could freeze on slow pc!</p>
         <h2>Running a PC without manual intervention</h2>
         <p>It is worth considering your energy bill and keeping running costs down.  If using a dedicated PC for data acquisition your PC should be running only between sunset and sunrise.</p>
         <p>Some Dell computers (and perhaps others) can be set up in bios to start up and shut down at specified times but this is not the only way to automate startup and shutdown.  In some windoiws versions it is possible to define wake-up and
             sleep times. Computer in sleep mode use considerably less power.</p>
