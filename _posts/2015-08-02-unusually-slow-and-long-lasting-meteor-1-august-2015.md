We are looking with interest at an unusually slow and long-lasting meteor which was captured on 1 August at 00:18.

It was perfectly framed by the Horley camera (operated by <a href="http://www.curtisfamily.org.uk/2015/08/unusually-slow-meteor/" target="\_blank">Chris Curtis</a>) and also captured by one of the Wilcot cameras, one of the Ash Vale cameras and by <a href="http://astronomytours.co.uk/about-us/team/nick-james" target="\_blank">Nick James</a> (in Chelmsford) who is part of the Nemetode meteor network. We hope that other cameras will have caught it too, allowing a precise orbit to be calculated.

### From Chelmsford camera ###

Initial calculations by <strong>Nick James</strong> suggest that the meteoroid had an orbit that stretched between the orbits of Earth and Mars and that the geocentric velocity was 6 km/s (or 13,400 mph)  but that is the velocity before the meteoroid was accelerated by the Earth's gravity. The entry velocity was more like 13 km/s, unusually slow for a meteor because it was traveling in the same direction as the Earth and so “catching up”.

It was not a particularly bright meteor, but would have been a fine sight as it took almost 9 seconds to cross a large part of the sky. Its path took it from above the English Channel to the Thames Estuary.

### From Horley South-East camera ###

### And also video from Richard Fleet's Wilcot camera: ###

Additionally we also found a match on Clanfield North East camera:
