Clanfield [Hampshire Astronomy Group](http://www.hantsastro.org.uk/){:target="\_blank"} joined UKMON in August 2012, with a two camera installation.

During processing of data for January, 2013, we found a beautiful fireball, but we were puzzled by the apparent slow speed; surely, this had to be a satellite re-entry. The team who looked at it (Steve Bosley, Steve Broadbent, David Harris, Graham Bryant and Peta Bosley) tried to identify a candidate satellite, without any success, so we parked it as one that got away ;-)

This year, Carlos Augusto di Pietro (from Brazil) posted to the EDMONd (European viDeo Meteor Observation Network) Facebook page, concerning 2 fireballs over Saudi Arabia that were evaluated by Ted Molczan as re-entry stage of the rocket launcher (NORAD 33052) of Chinasat-9.

This prompted me to comment on our 2013 fireball and Carlos, also a satellite watcher like Ted, offered to help identify it. By providing our station co-ordinates and exact time of capture, Carlos could run a simulation and check the satellite/space junk re-entry database of USSTRATCOM.

Unfortunately, the only re-entry around that date was of a Fengyun fragment and it was too small to produce a fireball of this magnitude. So, whatever we captured, it was a natural body!

We didn't get the result we hoped for, but did manage to initiate an inter-continental cross-check.
