Evening 1 June 2017 at 23:40 - 23:50 saw the usual ISS pass over the UK. A very popular event among general public and amateur astronomers.

But something else was spotted too. That evening we have started receiving fireball reports just minutes after midnight. It appears to be very bright meteor/fireball, lasting few seconds and been spotted from Nottingham to Guernsey but as far as French Lorient and Rennes.

Usually our cameras have good coverage Southern half of the UK but this time we have't found a match just yet.

[International Meteor Organization (IMO)](http://www.imo.net){:target="\_blank"} has been collecting all public reports and this event was marked as [1808-2017](http://fireballs.imo.net/imo_view/event/2017/1808){:target="\_blank"} and so far received over 50 reports. Unusually high number for meteor reports.
