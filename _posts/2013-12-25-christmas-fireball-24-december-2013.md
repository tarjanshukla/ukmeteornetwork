We were hoping for one and we got one. A beautiful Christmas fireball was recorded by three UKMON stations:

 - Richard Fleet at <a href="http://ukmeteornetwork.co.uk/2013/12/station-18-and-19-wilcot-north-west-and-south-west/">Wilcot station</a>
 - Norman Lockyer observatory Planetary and Meteor Detection team near <a href="http://ukmeteornetwork.co.uk/2013/01/station-6-and-7-sidmouth/">Sidmouth station</a>
 - Steve from Northern Ireland and his <a href="http://ukmeteornetwork.co.uk/2013/01/station-11-and-12-scotch-street/">Scotch Street station</a>
