We have received over 60 public reports about a fireball spotted on <strong>26 April 2015 at 22:10PM</strong>. First image is from <strong>Graham Roche</strong> and it looks like a very large fireball, could be around -10 magnitude or even brighter.

Beginning of fireball captured by another Scotch Street camera and also <strong>Richard Fleet</strong> (UKMON Wilcot station) has captured this fireball over 450 km away.

Big thanks to <a href="http://www.amsmeteors.org/" >American Meteor Society</a> and <a href="http://www.imo.net/" >International Meteor Organization </a>we have projected ground map from all public reports.

## Results: ##

Cooperating with our colleagues from other European networks we managed to get some rough calculations done, although with some level of inaccuracy we came to interesting conclusions:

<ul>
  <li>Initial velocity was very low, just 8.3 km/s</li>
  <li>Initial height 78 km</li>
  <li>Terminal height 31-32 km!</li>
  <li>Very steep entry angle</li>
  <li>The explosion was estimated at around -12 magnitude</li>
  <li>If anything has survived the final explosion it would not be more than 30-50 grams at most</li>
</ul>

And we have a ground map:

Orbit elements are:  a = 2.442 AU, q = 1.004 AU, e = 0.588, i = 3.818°, peri = 5.317°, node = 216.104°

And finally projected to Google Earth:
