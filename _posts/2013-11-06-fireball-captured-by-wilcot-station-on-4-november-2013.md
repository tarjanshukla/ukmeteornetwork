First fireball captured by Wilcot station on 4 November 2013 at 20:05:46 UT time, congratulations to Richard. This fireball event seems to be linked with recently heightened activity of Taurid meteor shower associated with the comet Encke. Unfortunately due to poor sky conditions no other UKMON camera has this event. Let's hope the next one will be captured from at least two stations so we can perform detailed orbit analysis.

### Here is the event video ###
