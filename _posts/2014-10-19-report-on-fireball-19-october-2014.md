We were alerted by public about fireball that happened on 19 October 2014 at 19:13:25 UT (20:13:25 BST) and received 10+ reports.

First confirmation came from our own Horley station operated by Chris where beginning of the event was indeed recorded (bottom left).

Then we received further confirmation from Oostkapelle video-allsky camera based in Holland, notice small image with meteor trail 6 minutes later.
