On 12 August 2015 Perseid Meteor shower was about to peak and across the channel a storm was brewing. UKMON managed to observe Perseid Meteor Shower till about 2 am that night (12-13 August), recorded large number of meteors, one fireball and Wilcot camera was treated to 3 recordings of sprites as well. What a night.
