UKMON was first alerted by the public about a large meteor spotted over the Southern part of UK. Quick check revealed Ash Vale and Wilcot cameras captured the event. Later on meteor was  verified also by Clanfield camera and French BOAM network. So far we have received dozen of public reports.

## Ash Vale South camera ##

## Wilcot South East camera ##

Perhaps the best view was from Clanfield Observatory at Hampshire Astonomical Group.

## GRAVES ##

Wilcot also got a strong radar reflection off this meteor as it was well placed for GRAVES

## Analysis and Orbit ##

Meteor analysis from Wilcot and Ash Vale show a ground map.

Interestingly object orbit reaches between Neptune and Pluto.
