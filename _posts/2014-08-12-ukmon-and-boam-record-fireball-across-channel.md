UK Meteor Observation Network has been collaborating with [French meteor observer database](http://www.boam.fr/post.php?lang=en){:target="\_blank"} (BOAM) for number of years and only now during 2014 Perseid meteor shower we have been lucky to record a large fireball across the two networks.

We call this one **BOAM's fireball** since we were alerted first by Tioga about event on 12 August 2014 at 00:05:31 UT

Norman Lockyer Observatory has recorded the fireball visually as well in radio spectrum:

Astonishingly Richard Fleet from Wilcot has also recorded this fireball in both spectrums:
