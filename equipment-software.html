         <p>UKMON relies on a suite of software developed by SonotaCo in Japan. There are three programmes in the SonotaCo UFO suite:</p>
         <ul>
             <li><strong><em>UFOCapture</em></strong>, a motion detection program that scans the video stream for moving objects and an object is detected, UFOCapture writes a short AVI sequence to a computer hard disk.</li>
             <li><strong><em>UFOAnalyser</em></strong>, which processes the AVI files and determines the type of event that was recorded, performs photometric and astrometric analysis to determine meteor properties and, if applicable, associates the
                 meteor with a shower.</li>
             <li><strong><em>UFOOrbit</em></strong>, which allows performs multi-station analysis and calculates precise trajectories and orbits.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>UFO Capture is highly configurable and provides a number of parameters that will enable discrimination of events to reduce false positives caused by aircraft, wildlife and satellites.</p>
         <p>UFOOrbit delivers high quality data by performing rigorous consistency and data quality checks to ensure that with insufficient accuracy or inappropriate pairing conditions are rejected</p>
         <p>The UFO suite is used by the <a title="Link to SonotaCo network" href="http://sonotaco.jp/" target="_blank">SonotaCo Network</a>, which has been operational since 2004 and is the currently largest existing video meteor network.</p>
         <h2>Why Sonotaco?</h2>
         <p>Existing meteor networks around the world are generally based on either the SonotaCo UFO suite or Metrec.  The UKMON network is based on the SonotaCo suite for a number of reasons, but in particular:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>SonotaCo is used by many other stations across Europe and therefore gives the UKMON community best opportunity to share data with other European networks.</li>
         </ul>
         <p><em>Note that Metrec, which is an excellent solution and is used by the International Meteor Organisation’s monitoring network, is designed to work with a specific make and model of video decoder that is no longer in production and which can be difficult to source.</em></p>
         <h2>Downloading the Software</h2>
         <p>The SonotaCo software can be downloaded from the <a title="Link to SonotaCo website" href="http://sonotaco.com/e_index.html" target="_blank">SonotaCo website</a>.</p>
         <h2>Licensing</h2>
         <p>UFO Capture requires a licence which is priced in Yen, but at current exchange rates is approximately £125.  For personal use, a licence is needed per person. For group use, licence is needed per computer.</p>
         <p>The use of UFO Analyszer and UFO Orbit is free to individual researchers.</p>
         <p>UFO Orbit is also available as a 30 day free trial.</p>
