                 <h2>The International Meteor Organization <br />(IMO)</h2>
                 <p>
                      The IMO was founded in 1988 and has more than 250 members now. It was created in response to an ever growing need for international cooperation of meteor amateur work. The collection of meteor observations by several methods from all around the world ensures the comprehensive study of meteor showers and their relation to comets and interplanetary dust.

                   Many UKMON members are also members of the IMO.  We have attended and even presented at past IMO summer conventions and have had papers published in the IMOâ€™s journal.  It brings together observers from across the world and gives UKMON access to a wealth of knowledge and expertise.

                      EDMOND is the remarkable result of cooperation and data sharing among participants of seven national networks.  Its database of orbits is based and computed upon high definition video data of observed meteor showers.  </p>

                 <p>
                   UKMON is one of the contributing networks, and through EDMOND all UKMON members have access to records of literally millions of meteor observations.

                      Not only does the Museum houses one of the world's finest collections of meteorites ( a collection contains approximately 2,000 individual meteorites in about 5,000 registered pieces) it is an important centre for research to meteorites.

                      The Natural History Museum joined UKMON when its first camera went live in 2015.  Since then UKMON has supported the museums outreach activities and has helped to install cameras at the William Perkin School in North West London and we look forward to even more collaboration.
